 EcoKind Bully Stick Bites are a 100% natural, single-ingredient dog chew that helps keep your pup's teeth clean and healthy. Plus, these bully stick pieces are made from grass-fed, free-range Brazilian cattle with no preservatives or chemicals added, making them a nutritious addition to your pup's daily routine!
</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">
 Each resealable bag contains 16 ounces or approximately 100 bully bites, ranging in size from 1 to 4 inches
</p>
<h2>
 Made With 100% Natural, Grass-Fed Beef
</h2>
<p>
 EcoKind bully stick bites for dogs are made from protein-packed, grass-fed beef muscle, so they taste great and are easily digestible. Dogs of all breeds and sizes go crazy for these high-protein, low-fat snacks!
</p>
<h2>
 A Safer &amp; Healthier Alternative to Rawhide
</h2>
<p>
 Rawhide is often processed in chemicals and cleaned with water or bleach which can be toxic if ingested by your dog! Our bully stick bites are made from 1 simple ingredient - grass-fed beef! We never use any chemicals, preservatives or additives during processing so you know you're getting a real, natural, all-beef treat for your best friend.
</p>
<h2>
 A Great Treat for all Dogs
</h2>
<p>
 From puppies to seniors, from Chihuahua's to Doberman's, bully stick bites can be enjoyed by any dog, no matter the size, breed or age. Yes, that's right! Even puppies can enjoy the same benefits that adults get from these delicious, healthy treats (as long as they can chew food on their own).
</p>
<h2>
 Helps Reduce Plaque and Bacteria
</h2>
<p>
 Dental hygiene is an important part of keeping your pup healthy, but you can make it easier to maintain clean teeth by adding EcoKind Bully Sticks to their daily routine.
</p>
<p>
 Tough chews, like Bully Sticks, help remove plaque from a dog's gums and prevent future build-up. They have also been proven to reduce the number of bacteria on their teeth by 60%

 , which can help prevent periodontal disease.

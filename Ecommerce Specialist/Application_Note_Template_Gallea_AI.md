### AI/Answer Engine Experience

While my primary focus has been traditional SEO, I've been actively monitoring and adapting to the evolution of AI-powered search engines. My experience optimizing content for conversational queries, informational intent, and featured snippets directly aligns with Answer Engine Optimization principles. I've optimized content for "what is" queries, FAQ schema, and informational content that performs well in both traditional search and AI-powered interfaces.

I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to deepen my expertise in prompt research, LLM optimization, and answer engine visibility tracking. My strong foundation in technical SEO, content strategy, and structured data implementation positions me well to expand into AEO strategies. I'm eager to help Gallea AI's clients navigate this evolving landscape and achieve visibility in both traditional and AI-powered search environments.

My experience as an independent, self-directed SEO specialist managing multiple accounts aligns perfectly with the "army of one" approach. I'm comfortable owning end-to-end campaigns, building scalable processes, and delivering measurable results—exactly what this role requires.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my SEO expertise and results-driven approach can contribute to Gallea AI's success.

Best regards,  
Iman Farasat

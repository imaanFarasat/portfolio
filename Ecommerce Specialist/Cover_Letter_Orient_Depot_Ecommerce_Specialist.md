Dear Hiring Manager,

I came across your Ecommerce Specialist posting and I'm really excited about this opportunity. After reading about the role and what you're looking for, I think my experience managing multi-channel ecommerce operations would be a great fit for your team.

For the past few years, I've been working hands-on with Shopify stores and various marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Pinterest. What really stands out to me about this role is that you need someone who can handle the day-to-day operations across different platforms, and that's exactly what I've been doing. I've managed product listings, kept inventory updated in real-time, and handled order fulfillment for multiple clients.

One project I'm particularly proud of is managing 20,000+ product variants for a jewelry client. It was challenging at first, but I learned how to handle complex inventory systems and keep everything organized. I also built an automated system using Google Sheets and APIs to sync product data to Shopify, which saved a lot of manual work. I think this kind of problem-solving approach would be useful at Orient Depot.

I've got solid experience with Shopify - been working with it for over two years now across different clients. I know my way around the backend, can manage product catalogs, set up promotions, and handle all the technical stuff like API integrations. I've also worked extensively with Amazon and Walmart marketplaces, so I'm comfortable managing listings and inventory across multiple channels.

On the marketing side, I've done SEO work that got some keywords ranking #1 on Google, and I've managed email campaigns that performed really well. I know you mentioned digital marketing experience is an asset, so I thought that might be relevant.

What I like about this role is that it's not just about managing products - it's about contributing to growth and being part of a team. I'm the kind of person who pays attention to details, can juggle multiple priorities, and I'm always looking for ways to improve processes. I'm also comfortable with general office tasks and administrative work, which I know is part of the role.

I'm based in Toronto and I'm ready to start right away. I'd love the chance to talk more about how my experience could help Orient Depot grow its ecommerce channels.

Thanks for considering my application. I've attached my resume and I'm happy to provide any additional information you might need.

Best regards,

Iman Farasat

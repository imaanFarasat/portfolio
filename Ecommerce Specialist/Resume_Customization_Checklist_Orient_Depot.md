   - Emphasize quick learning ability and adaptability
   - Mention any online courses or self-study

2. **Use Action Verbs:**
   - Managed, Created, Optimized, Executed, Monitored, Coordinated

   - "Managed 500+ product listings" vs "Managed product listings"
   - "Processed 50+ orders daily" vs "Processed orders"

4. **Match Keywords:**
   - Use exact terms from job posting: "Shopify", "Amazon", "inventory management", "order fulfillment"
   - This helps with ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)

   - Focus on ecommerce, admin, and customer service experience
   - Remove unrelated work experience or keep it brief

## About Wellwise

Wellwise Home Health & Wellness is a growing Canadian leader in home healthcare retail, committed to empowering Canadians to age well and live independently. We are in the midst of an exciting digital transformation — integrating best-in-class ERP, POS, and eCommerce platforms — and we're looking for a dynamic eCommerce Specialist to help drive our online business forward.

## Position Overview

We are seeking an experienced eCommerce Specialist to manage and optimize our online store operations, support digital growth initiatives, and lead continuous website improvements to deliver a best-in-class shopping experience. The ideal candidate is both analytical and creative, thrives in a fast-paced environment, and has a strong passion for eCommerce innovation, usability, and customer experience.

## Key Responsibilities

### eCommerce Operations

• Manage the day-to-day operations of our Shopify Plus store, including product listings, pricing, promotions, and inventory synchronization.

• Ensure catalog accuracy — item master data, descriptions, images, categorization — and compliance with accessibility and healthcare regulations.

• Monitor and resolve order management issues (e.g., failed transactions, fulfillment errors, refunds, and returns).

• Liaise with 3PL and internal supply chain teams to ensure smooth inventory availability and delivery.

### Digital Growth, Website Improvement & Optimization

• Execute site merchandising strategies: homepage banners, seasonal campaigns, cross-selling/upselling flows.

• Drive website enhancements and continuous UX/UI improvements to increase conversion, engagement, and customer satisfaction.

• Collaborate with marketing to optimize email/SMS automation, loyalty integrations, and customer engagement campaigns.

• Implement and manage Shopify applications that enhance functionality, improve the shopping journey, and support growth initiatives.

• Apply eCommerce best practices for site navigation, checkout optimization, personalization, and product discovery.

• Support SEO, SEM, and CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) initiatives.

• Analyze user behavior and funnel performance to recommend actionable website and content improvements.

### Systems & Integrations

• Partner with IT to support ERP–eCommerce integrations (Microsoft Dynamics 365 BC, LS Retail POS, Shopify Plus, BigQuery, SFTP pipelines).

• Assist with data cleansing and mapping (products, vendors, customers) to ensure platform consistency.

• Support migration projects and system testing (UAT, regression, sandbox validation).

### Analytics & Reporting

• Build and maintain dashboards using Power BI, Shopify Analytics, and Google Analytics to track KPIs: traffic, sales, conversion, retention.

• Provide actionable insights on category performance, promotion ROI, and customer engagement trends.

• Present findings and recommendations to senior leadership to inform business decisions.

## Qualifications

• 3–5 years of hands-on eCommerce experience (Shopify Plus strongly preferred).

• Proven experience implementing eCommerce best practices and leveraging Shopify applications to enhance site functionality and customer experience.

• Knowledge of ERP/POS integrations (Microsoft Dynamics 365, LS Retail is an asset).

• Experience with digital marketing tools (Klaviyo, Yotpo, Google Analytics, SEO/SEM).

• Proficiency in Excel/Power BI for data analysis and reporting.

• Basic technical skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or Liquid templating) are an asset.

• Strong attention to detail with excellent problem-solving and cross-functional communication skills.

• Experience in retail, healthcare, or consumer goods is considered a plus.

## Why Join Us

• Be part of a transformative digital journey in Canadian healthcare retail.

• Work with cutting-edge eCommerce technologies and platforms.

• Lead impactful website improvement initiatives that directly shape the customer experience.

• Collaborative and growth-oriented team environment.

• Competitive salary, benefits, and opportunities for advancement.
